## How to clone the repository ?

   - https method : `git clone https://github.com/clubrobot/team-2024.git team2024`
   - ssh method : `git clone git@github.com:clubrobot/team-2024.git team2024`

2. Well Done ! The code is now on your computer.

## How to setup the project ?

> The next step is to configure the project and download all the required tools and libraries.

### If you want to work on the raspberypi

1. We work with ssh, refer to the discord for IP and passwords
2. run the python scripts and if you get an import error just install it lol

### If you want to work on embedded devices:
1. Install PlatformIO via the extension tab and let it install

#### There are two ways to work on projects:

1. Open the general 'elec' workspace (more complex) and then open the project via the platformIO home (left tab)

   >  `code team2024_elec.code-workspace` in a terminal or via the interface

2. Open a single project folder (more simple) via VScode
   
   > `code platformIO\PROJECT_FOLDER` it should init platformio and everything
   > or, on windows, right-click on the folder and do "open with vscode"
   HELLO WORD
